## 🔄 Implementation Workflow

Following OpenSpec's three-stage workflow:

### Stage 1: Creating Changes ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Reviewed project context
- [x] Created 4 change proposals with proposal.md
- [x] Created 4 tasks.md files with implementation checklists
- [x] Created 4 spec deltas with ADDED Requirements
- [x] Validated all changes with `openspec validate --strict`

### Stage 2: Implementing Changes ⏳ READY TO START

**Waiting for your approval to begin implementation**

Recommended order:

1. Implement `add-mineru-vllm-integration` (foundation)
2. Implement `add-batch-processing-system` (builds on #1)
3. Implement `add-enhanced-markdown-generation` (integrates with #2)
4. Implement `add-performance-optimization` (optimizes #1 and #2)

### Stage 3: Archiving Changes ⏸️ AFTER DEPLOYMENT

- Move to openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/
- Update specs/ directory with deployed capabilities
- Run final validation

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Review Proposals

```bash
# List all changes
openspec list

# View specific proposal
openspec show add-mineru-vllm-integration
openspec show add-batch-processing-system
openspec show add-enhanced-markdown-generation
openspec show add-performance-optimization

# View spec differences (currently all ADDED since this is new)
openspec diff add-mineru-vllm-integration
```

### To Approve and Start Implementation

Simply say: **"Approved, please implement all changes"** or **"Approved, implement change 1 first"**

I will then:

1. Implement tasks sequentially from tasks.md
2. Mark tasks complete as they're done (- [x])
3. Test each capability before moving on
4. Ensure all requirements and scenarios are satisfied

### To Modify Before Implementation

If you want to adjust any proposal:

1. Tell me what to change (e.g., "Reduce workers to 10", "Skip performance profiles")
2. I'll update the relevant proposal.md, tasks.md, or spec.md
3. Re-validate with `openspec validate --strict`
4. Get approval and proceed

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**: Each capability is independent and composable
2. **File-Based Coordination**: Lock files prevent duplicate processing (simple, reliable)
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Can use basic features without advanced optimization
4. **Safety First**: Resource monitoring, graceful shutdown, retry logic
5. **Performance Profiles**: Flexibility to choose throughput vs latency vs balanced
6. **RAG-Ready Output**: Structured Markdown with clear section boundaries
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: 95+ scenarios ensure quality

## 🎓 How to Work With Me Using OpenSpec

As documented in `openspec/AGENTS.md`:

1. **Point me to specs**: I'll read before acting
2. **Proposals before code**: For new features, I create validated proposals first
3. **Task execution**: Once approved, I implement in order, marking checkboxes
4. **Validation**: I run `openspec validate` to ensure correctness
5. **Communication**: Clear about what stage we're in

You're currently at: **Stage 1 Complete** → Ready for **Stage 2 (Implementation)**

## ❓ Questions?

- "Show me task details for change X" → I'll display specific tasks.md
- "Explain requirement Y" → I'll show the spec requirement and scenarios
- "What modules will be created?" → Check the "Affected code" in each proposal.md
- "How long will this take?" → Depends on implementation speed; 138 tasks total
- "Can I modify X?" → Yes! Tell me what to change before implementation
