# Proposal: Performance Optimization for High-End Hardware

## Why

The system has exceptional hardware (RTX 5090 24GB GPU, 192GB RAM, AMD 9950x 16-core CPU) that should be fully utilized. Default configurations don't maximize these resources. Specific optimizations for vLLM engine parameters, memory allocation, CPU thread utilization, and I/O operations will dramatically improve throughput and reduce latency.

## What Changes

- Configure vLLM engine parameters for RTX 5090 (tensor parallel size, KV cache, etc.)
- Set optimal worker count based on CPU cores (12-14 workers for 16-core CPU)
- Configure memory allocation to use up to 150GB for processing buffers
- Enable CPU thread pinning for worker processes
- Optimize I/O with buffered reads/writes and async operations where beneficial
- Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Create performance tuning profiles (balanced, throughput, latency)

## Impact

- Affected specs: **performance-optimization** (new capability)
- Affected code:
  - New module: `src/MinerUExperiment/performance_config.py` - performance tuning profiles
  - New module: `src/MinerUExperiment/metrics.py` - performance metrics collection
  - Modified: `src/MinerUExperiment/mineru_config.py` - add vLLM engine parameters
  - Modified: `src/MinerUExperiment/batch_processor.py` - apply performance settings
- Dependencies: Requires **mineru-integration** and **batch-processing** capabilities
